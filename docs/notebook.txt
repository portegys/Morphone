A morphogenesis experiment.

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the properties of a
CA in which the cells exchange mediating signals, as living cells might do.
A further enhancement would have "hormones" exert more global influences.

The CA consists of an array of "live" and "dead" cells.  Live cells have an
orientation and color.

Each live cell receives a set of signals from adjacent cells, acts on it,
and outputs signals to adjacent cells.

The signals form coordinates in a signal space, in which each point 
provides a programmed action/output.

Actions:
- Create adjacent live cell (if not blocked). (3 bits)
- Kill adjacent cell. (3 bits)
- Reorient adjacent cell (3 bits).
- Rotate x 1-3. (2 bits)
- Flip UD/LR (mirror). (2 bits)
- Set color. (log2 NCOLOR bits, for B/W 1 bit).
Total: 14 bits.

To evolve using GA:
The number of bits in the genome is (Action + Output) x Signal space size.
Signal space size = 2^NSIG for on/off signals.

To reduce, cluster the space?  What else?

--------------------------------------

Revised:

Signals can have varying extents (radii) (on/off over extent).
Idea here is to use larger signals extents as overarching 
mediators which turn on/off other signals/actions (like Mona).
The action/outputs are toggled entities, i.e. once set/unset, they
must be explicitely unset/set.

Procedure:

1. Input: Live cell senses signals and takes action indicated.

2. Actions: (1) set color, (2), create adj. cells (w/orientation set),
  (3) kill adj. cells, (4) reorient adj. cells.

3. Output specified signal set.

So, a precursor cell could first create "arms", then based on input
from arm cells, create legs, then head, etc.

I've started Morphone.java, hopefully with enough mass to enable me to
pick it up probably in early August, since it must go on ice now until then.

1/26/00

By the way, Tom of last July, I had to figure out the "morphone" was a
contraction of morpho-hormone, or some such thing.

1/27/00

Settling a bit - coalescing. Annealing?
With the hormone model, each type of hormone will have a range and
directionality associated with it, thus allowing symmetries to be
made and broken.  Hormones will also have colors possibly tagged
onto them.  Also, each cell will have an function table which
matches input hormones to output ones.

1/28/00

More ideas:  each hormone can percolate along the 8 possible 
directions for a limited range.  Also, one of the effects of
a hormone is to orient the receiving cell according to the
direction that the hormone arrives from.

2/21/00

Slow going due to hectic life.  However, as I am favored with this
glimpse into God's mind, I shall keep the metal malleable.

5/11/00

Back to work after submitting Mona to Adaptive Behavior.  Now, where
was I?

6/1/00

Almost done with core program.  Still haven't heard from Adaptive 
Behavior about receipt of paper.

6/2/00

Finished coding core today.

6/9/00

Debugging.  Have some ideas about how to evolve and have made some
preparations for it.

Heard from Adapative Behavior - paper in review.

6/13/00

Still debugging and polishing.  Trying some sample patterns.

6/19/00

Debugging first non-trivial pattern.

6/20/00

Idea: instead of current "condition" implementation, use "weights",
positive and negative coefficients which when summing to positive,
can trigger a morphogen.

6/21/00

More thoughts:  1) extent should be the output of the weighting summation,
and/or, 2) hormones should dissipate/attenuate over their extent.

Trying to relate fractals and chaos to this.

6/30/00

Implementing weights idea.

7/3/00

Got weights, attenuation, and secretion reset done.  Testing example
pattern.

7/6/00

"Goal post" genotype tested.  "Box" genotype next.  Then on to 
evolution program.

7/7/00

Tested "Star of David" genotype.  I guess it is time to start the
evolution program.

7/14/00

Had some complications connected with being able to do fractal-like
patterns.  I've decided to get the program working, then put the
evolve program on hold in order to work on other stuff.  

Notes for evolve: I've taken care to quantitize the variables to
allow them to be laid out in bit patterns for mutation and cross-over.
See the parameters in Genotype.  Also, if desired to add a probabilistic
element to the morph, a "random" weight could be attached to the
processing of each morphogen.

7/17/00

I've decided to let all parameters reside in the evolve program, allowing
the morph program to accept an unconstrained genotype.

A speculation: is the morphogenesis algorithm amenable to error-reduction
a la the backpropagation algorithm?  Does the threshold function need
to be "smoothed" to allow this?  My feeling is that, while some determinism
must exist to allow for a genetic algorithm to work, this is a weaker
condition than that which would be necessary for a guaranteed error-reduction.
But, I don't know.

Finished debugging three examples.  On the shelf it goes.

9/13/00

See IEEE Computer Mag. (9/00) for references to parallel CA machines.

2/12/01

Had a couple of thoughts: If attenuating the hormone output, could
use a probablistic modulo function to achieve a "tiger stripe" effect.
Also, could use a negation of an absolute value of a difference to 
achieve a triggering of an attenuated signal at a specific distance
without also broadcasting a "one less" inhibition signal.

6/5/01

Yesterday had an idea to embody signals as attenuating sine waves, and
the outputs are based on a function of combining such to produce further
sine waves.  But then I thought things wander too far towards the Fourier
realm.

Now I'm thinking of embodying the genotype as a set of cellular engines,
each computing some extracellular outputs from intracellular inputs.
How to represent these machines as bit fields or such for evolution?
Turing machines?  

6/23/01

Came up with "metabolic" functions for the morphogens.  Must try to get
to stable state before moving on.

6/25/01

Finished coding.  Test tomorrow.

7/10/01

Got the demos working.

9/26/01

Finished the evolution program.  Need to write phenotype
pattern builder.

10/4/01

Almost done with pattern painter.

10/11/01

Finished pattern painter.  Starting to debug Evolve.

10/23/01

Decided to change evolution to be more "purposeful".  Will
have two stages.  Stage one will select quantities of hormones,
and hormone, color, orientation morphs, and metabolics, randomly
generating values of these.  Stage one is about determining 
which amounts genetic material are needed to solve a task.
Stage two will mutate these quantities, this determining what
content produces success.  Then take the successful stage one
genotypes and mutate them by varying quantities, possibly 
by a hill-climbing process.

11/21/01

Implemented above plan, cleaned up some stuff, and am back at
testing.

11/30/01

Thinking of changing directions and building a hierarchical
language to express patterns in.

12/10/01

More on the previous.  Change Metabolic to Morphogen (since metabolic
energy comsumption, which this is not); remove all three morphogens
and encapsulate into the morphogenic function.

For validity, must be able to convert morphogenic function into bits,
representing genetic evolution; for this, should also code in
terminating codons to isolate mutations to individual morphogens.

12/11/01

Decided to dynamically load a derived class of an abstract Genotype,
and to hand-code the genotype stuff in the derived class.

12/18/01

Yes, Virginia, I've decided to rip things up and start again.  This
time hormones will be instantiated objects secreted from cell to
cell.  The instantiation can take the form of arbitrary parameters,
including other hormones(!), thus implementing polymorphic hormones.
Upon absorption, the hormone will be invoked and given the other
hormones present in the cell as input.  It may be secrete other
hormones, change color, or vary the orientation of the cell.

12/19/01

The morphone model is still different from other CAs, even ones (I
can't recall the type name) wherein cells morph depending on a non-
uniform dispersed set of other cells, this being because of the delay
factor in hormone propagation.

12/27/01

To build:

- Flower/tree grown from seed
- Insect from egg containing head, thorax (2/6 legs), abdomen (banded)
- Spores that bud into fungi that keep spacing between each other; these
  grow old after releasing spores and die.
- "Pong" between two paddles.
- Glider gun, reflector.
- Fractals: Serpinski triangle, "Mandelbrot", recursive spirals.
- Turing machine.
- Music composition.

1/4//02

Got old patterns working, plus a fractal spiral, glider gun, and
a spiraling glider gun.

1/30/02

For bug, need a genotype that describes architecture.  A gene will 
indicate the number of segments and the types of each.  For each
segment type, a shape gene will determine its shape, also its
coloration (maybe this is global - from highest level?), where it
should grow relative to other segments, and its features: eyes, legs,
antennae, etc.  There will also be genes for the types of legs, eyes,
etc, that may vary.  Thus by mutating the genes, can get various
types of bugs to hatch.

2/14/02

Ran upon L-Systems, an important capability to be able to model. Am 
in the process of doing this, which should satisfy the "plant growth"
requirement.

2/22/02

Finished simple L-System implementation.

3/22/02

Working on Turing machine.  Paper due May 6.

3/30/2002

Nearly done with Turing machine.  Hope to have "bug" done or nearly
so next week, as must get started writing.

4/5/02

Finished Turing counter and adder.  Gathering reference materials.
Next week to code bug.

4/15/02

Title: "An abstraction of intercellular communication"

4/19/02

Finished bug.  Getting images for paper.

3/7/03

ACAL deadline in early June. Thinking of evolving cilia or hair/feathers 
or vacuoles from cells. Vacuoles could also be used for capturing prey. Something
from a membrane.
